# App1 – Fracciones Rítmicas

This demo explores rhythmic fractions and how they combine into cycles. Adjust the controls and observe the generated patterns.

## Usage

Serve the repository locally and open `apps/app1/index.html` in your browser:

```bash
npx http-server
```

Navigate to the URL shown by the command and open the app.

## Shared Libraries

App1 uses the common CSS from `libs/shared-ui` to keep the style consistent across apps.

Tests for the shared utilities can be run from the repository root with:

```bash
npm test
```
